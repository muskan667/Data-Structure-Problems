There are certain problems which are asked in the interview to also check how you take care of overflows in your problem.
This is one of those problems.
Please take extra care to make sure that you are type-casting your ints to long properly and at all places. Try to verify if your solution works if number of elements is as large as 105


vector<int> Solution::repeatedNumber(const vector<int> &A) {
     vector<int> ans;
    long long n = A.size(), x = 0, y = 0;
    
    long long sum = (n*(n+1))/2;
    
    long long sumSq = (n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6;
    
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        sum -= (long long)A[i];
        sumSq -= (long long)A[i]*(long long)A[i];
    }
    
    y = (sum + sumSq/sum)/2;
    x = y-sum;
    
    ans.push_back(x);   // repeat
    ans.push_back(y);   // missing
    
    return ans;
}
