Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


int Solution::maxDepth(TreeNode* A) {
    if(!A)
        return 0;
        
    return 1 + max(maxDepth(A -> left), maxDepth(A -> right));
}
